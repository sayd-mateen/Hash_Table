# Hash_Table

Performance Analysis: Hash Table 
The java codes will analyze the time difference between the two types of hash tables: Linked implementation and Probing implementation.

A Test of the codes gave me the following results. 

Run #1:
Time amount for Linked implementation is: 1471041149ns
Time amount for Probing implementation is: 73090964ns

Run #2:
Time amount for Linked implementation is: 1496407796ns
Time amount for Probing implementation is: 73695882ns

Run #3:
Time amount for Linked implementation is: 1390651336ns
Time amount for Probing implementation is: 68933356ns

Run #4:
Time amount for Linked implementation is: 1499298766ns
Time amount for Probing implementation is: 71338202ns

Compare: 
The probing technique looks to always be faster than the linked implementation. 

Analysis: 
The time complexity of the linked implementation is more than the probing which shows that the probing hash table is more effective than the linked implementation. This is because the probing uses a key, which allows for quicker access to the number that is desired.
